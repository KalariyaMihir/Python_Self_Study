# Practice of Type casting and type Conversion

# Example of type conversion
# in type conversion it's automatically change the data type of variable
a = 10
b = 5.5

print( a + b)


# Example of type casting
# in type casting we have to forcefully change the type of variable
A = int('10')
B = 5.5

print( A + B)
